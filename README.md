# -Rust-Shopping-Cart-Closures-Ownership-Practice
A small Rust project built to practice ownership, borrowing, and closures by modeling a real-world shopping cart system.  This project focuses on how behavior can be passed into functions safely using Rust’s type system instead of hard-coding logic.
