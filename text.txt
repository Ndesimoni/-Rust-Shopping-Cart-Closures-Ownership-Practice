/*

 
Declare a `total_price` variable initialized to 0.0.
Invoke the `checkout` method and pass in a closure.
The closure should receive mutable ownership of the
`ShoppingCart` struct. In the body of the closure, output
the cart in Debug format.
 
Then, call the `traverse_items` closure IN THIS closure.
Pass in a closure to `traverse_items`. The nested closure
should increment the `total_price` value so that it gathers
the cumulative sum of all of the `SupermarketItem`'s prices.
 
Print out the final value of the `total_price` variable
with a precision of 2 decimal points and a dollar sign
in front.
